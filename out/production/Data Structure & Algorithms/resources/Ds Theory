******************** Algorithm Complexities ******************
BIG O Notation

****** Growth rates ******
Liner =  Single Loop.
Quadratic = loop inside of loop.
Cubic Growth Rate = loop inside loop inside loop -> for{ for { for }}}

****** Asymptotic Notation ******
n = Number of input.
Linear Growth Rate = O(n)
Quadratic Growth Rate = O(n^2)
Constant Growth Rate = O(1) -> One single operation regardless of number of input size.

What if you don't know the number of loop to fix the problem ?

Exponential  = O(n^n)
